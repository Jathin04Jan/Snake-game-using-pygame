# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen eating food, which grows the snake and increases the player's score. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Jathin04Jan/Snake-game-using-pygame.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd snake-game`
3. **Install Pygame**: `pip3 install pygame`
4. **Run the game**: `python game.py`

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
- **Scoring System**: The player's score increases every time the snake eats food.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Game Loop**: The game loop keeps the game running until the player loses or quits.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a high score system to keep track of the top scores.
- Add different levels of difficulty to make the game more challenging.
- Include power-ups or obstacles to spice up the gameplay.
